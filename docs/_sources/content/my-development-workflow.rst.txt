My Development Workflow
#######################

..  include::  /header.inc

In this section, I will describe the workflow I use to build almost any project.
The workflow is based on a work pattern I evolved in my last 17-year teaching work. I usually
put together dozens of small projects for each class I taught. Since I taught on
average four courses for the spring and Fall terms, and two classes in the
Summer term, and each class had on the order of a dozen projects, I racked up a
lot of projects. In the beginning, I did
not use a formal workflow. Then I introduced *Subversion* to my project
management tool set and my work pattern changed. AAdd to that *Continuous
Integration* and *Test-Driven Development, and the work flow needed to get more
rigerous. In 2005, when *Git* was first released, I switched to Git as my code
manage,ent tool of choice. The final piece of the puzzle was the addition of
GitHub as a master home for all project resources. 

Most of my code lives in public repositories on GitHUb. I have used *Github
Classroom* for student work submitted for grades. Those repositories are private
with only the student and teacher having access to them. I also was able to set
upm student teams for larger projects, again private since they were user in
assigning grades to the students.
